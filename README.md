#  ObjC Framework for Debugger Challenge
This simple repo was written to support the Debugger Challenge repo.  

##### REMINDER
You must make the header file `public`. so the app embedding the file can invoke the Class.  If you don't, the Swift compiler will complain.

##### TO DO
Change to a universal framework (`arm64` and `x86/64`)
